Welcome,

This is my first project in completion of my Diploma at Code Institute. **Haven Hub Care Services** is intended for a real company that recently got starteed in the United Kingdom. The idea of Haven hub is to give visibility to the company on the internet. The website seeks to present key contact information about the company, and collect information from people that are interested in its services and offers. The last update to this 

## **Testing**

Various tools have been used in testing the the overall performance of the website from begining to end. I have listed them in no particular other below:

`Google PageSpeed Insights:`
Google page speed insights was used to test the speed of the website and various issues were highlighted which was followed by subsequent adjustments.
A notable issue raised was that of the body font bing high in contrast. The font (Diphlliea) was then changed to Roboto. High contrast fonts are difficult to read by some users and also on some devices.

`W3 Validator:`
1. The W3 validator (validator.w3.org) highlighted errors on the website's links. Arial-label instead of aria-label had been used, and 15 errors were found and corrected.
2. A <p> element hhad been left exposed on the about section and this was detected and corrected afterwards.


## Tools
1. Deque's University Color Contrast Analyzer was used to determine what colors go together This ensures that users of all kind can clearly view texts and image/button borders. Some users might be color blind or are people with low vision experience. This tool ensures that the best colours are used in other to gurantee their convenience. A brief understanding of this would be an instance where a white text is put on a yellow backrougnd. Both colors are too bnright and would be difficult to read for most users.
